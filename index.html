            <p>Manuel Aires Mateus‘s Melbourne visit was a reunion for me. I was taught by him in 2001, and it remains one of my most memorable studio experiences. So when I saw his name on the speaker list I was keen to catch up with him and offered my services as a tour guide (conveniently leaving out the fact that I have a terrible sense of direction).</p>
            <p>The first thing Mateus asked our design studio was to recollect our first memory. Peter Zumthor has written about this in his publication titled Experiencing Architecture, where memories are recalled “without thinking about it.”1 We all struggled with this, confusing our first memory with our architectural education. Eventually we gave examples like hiding under the sheets as a child or going down the slip-and-slide in the backyard. I asked him while we were having a coffee at Pellegrini’s (the first of six for the day) why he asked this, and he told me that architecture is about experience and these memories illustrate an architecture we should be seeking to reproduce – not by copying the design, but by learning about what made the experience. The scene happening within this busy cafe, Mateus explained, is a good example of this – the “precision” of the baristas and waiters is linked seamlessly to the space. This seamlessness is about the way the space has been used over time. For Mateus, architecture is about considering the individual’s connection to a place, and continuing the history of it.</p>
